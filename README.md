# scrcpy_autoconnect_wifi_postreboot
A custom batch script to streamline wireless scrcpy connections on Windows, including post-reboot recovery and automation.

What it can do:

-Allow you to interact with your phone through scrcpy and adb shell to unlock it ***REQUIRES PREVIOUS SET UP IF YOUR PHONE'S TOUCH FUNCTIONALITY IS DEAD, DON'T @ ME***

-That's all it can do.
